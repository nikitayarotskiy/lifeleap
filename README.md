# LifeLeap

LifeLeap is a dynamic platform designed for simulating population growth, demographic changes, and personalized life paths. It empowers users to explore how societies evolve over time through advanced statistical modeling and individual data generation.


## Prerequisites
Before running the application, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) (comes with Node.js)

## How to Run
1. **Download the Code**
   - You can either download the code as a ZIP file or clone the repository:
     ```sh
     git clone https://github.com/nikitayarotskiy/lifeleap.git
     ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory:
     ```sh
     cd lifeleap
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:
     ```sh
     npm install
     ```

4. **Start the Application**
   - Once the dependencies are installed, start the application with:
     ```sh
     npm start
     ```
   - This will launch the application in your default web browser. The default URL is usually `http://localhost:3000`.
## The Algorithm

The algorithm simulates population growth and demographic changes over time by generating an initial dataset of population statistics, including birth and death rates, life expectancy, and dependency ratios based on a specified population size. This dataset is updated annually, adjusting population size through births, deaths, and migration while accounting for changes in median age, life expectancy, and other demographic factors. Additionally, it creates a list of individuals with randomly assigned names, ages, genders, and image paths. This list is updated over time by aging individuals and replacing those who surpass a certain age threshold with newly generated people.

## Usefulness

LifeLeap serves as a comprehensive tool for exploring demographic trends, personal growth simulations, and societal dynamics. Users can observe how factors like birth rates, aging, and migration shape communities over time, making it ideal for educational purposes, research, and future planning. The platform’s ability to generate personalized data about individuals—including names, ages, and visual representations—allows users to engage with life simulations interactively. Whether understanding population changes or exploring personal life paths, LifeLeap provides a unique blend of data-driven insights and personal exploration.

## Future Potential

This technology has the potential to evolve into a more sophisticated platform by integrating advanced AI and data analytics, creating highly detailed, real-time simulations of societal trends. By incorporating machine learning, LifeLeap could predict not only demographic changes but also the economic, environmental, and health impacts on populations, offering deeper insights for decision-makers. Expanding to include real-world data sources, such as census and economic statistics, would enhance the accuracy and relevance of projections.

Furthermore, LifeLeap could evolve into a platform offering personalized life simulations for users, integrating data on individual behaviors, preferences, and goals. This could aid people in making informed decisions about career paths, retirement planning, or health outcomes based on predictive modeling. By broadening its scope, LifeLeap could become a vital resource for government agencies, businesses, and individuals, supporting long-term strategic planning, urban development, and personal life coaching.

## Hackathon Acknowledgment

LifeLeap was developed during a hackathon by Nikita Yarotskiy and Kiarad Z. We collaborated to create this innovative platform, leveraging our skills in programming and demographic analysis.
